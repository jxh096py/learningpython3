### Exercise 1 (Basic Validations and Functions)

Take in the first input number from the command line, call it a

Take in a secod input number from the command line, call it b

Then print out the sum of a and b i.e. a+b

Your program should print the following (e.g where user enters 5 and 2 as their numbers:

```
  the first number you've entered is: 5
  the second number you've entered is: 2
  5 + 2 = 7
```

**Extension Tasks**:

1.  _**(easy)**_ Can you ensure that the user running your program is indeed entering a type int, not random gibberish?
2.  _**(intermediate)**_ Move the code which does the addition to a function called addNumbers which takes in two numbers and outputs the result. Return this back to the calling code and print it to the console.
