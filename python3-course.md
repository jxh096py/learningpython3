Course Material

The following things will be needed to get started with the course.
a .pdf or hard copy (go used) of Head First Python (2nd Edition) by Paul Barry
access to a decently spec'd Windows Laptop or Macbook (around 4GB RAM / i5+)
access to WhatsApp 'Coding Help'
access to this Slite documentation
determination and perseverance!
How To Learn
The 'Head Start' series is typically made for people who have the briefest exposure to scripting or programming using any kind of language, and knowing the basic concepts of programming such as variable declaration, looping. Generally, however, Head Start is a great way to learn basic to intermediate concepts with relative speed.
The course will be primarily self-led and you will be learning from the book. On this page, you will find assigned exercises ('homework') which will test your knowledge and add relevant pressure to ensure you are learning and delivering at a good pace.
In addition to these exercises, I will be running open sessions on teams where you can raise topics you do not understand. I will then demonstrate and go through concepts that you are struggling with. I suggest you don't have your IDEs open in these sessions and try and follow along as I code; rather, you should make notes or use the code I put together to try these examples yourself. We will record some of the topics covered in these sessions on this page.
You can also raise questions on the WhatsApp group, this will be a good way to learn
Open Sessions

Exercises
In this section you will find the exercises set, when they were set, and (if applicable) when they are due. If you are struggling, use the WhatsApp group so we can all help one another. Once you are familiar with Github / git, I expect these to be hosted out of git.
Exercise ONE (Basic Math) — Due 29th August 2023
Take in the first input number from the command line, call it a
Take in a secod input number from the command line, call it b
Then print out the sum of a and b i.e. a+b
Your program should print the following (e.g where user enters 5 and 2 as their numbers:
the first number you've entered is: 5
the second number you've entered is: 2
5 + 2 = 7
Extension Tasks:
(easy) Can you ensure that the user running your program is indeed entering a type int, not random gibberish?
(intermediate) Move the code which does the addition to a function called addNumbers which takes in two numbers and outputs the result. Return this back to the calling code and print it to the console.
